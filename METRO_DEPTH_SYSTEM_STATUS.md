# Metro Depth & Foundation System - Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED Components

### 1. Foundation Analysis System
**File**: `src/utils/foundationAnalysis.ts` (300+ lines)

**Features Implemented**:
- ✅ Obstacle detection (buildings, bedrock, water table, utilities, archaeological sites)
- ✅ 4 depth options (Surface, Shallow 10m, Medium 25m, Deep 50m)
- ✅ Cost calculation with multipliers based on obstacles
- ✅ Construction time estimation
- ✅ Difficulty rating (1-10)
- ✅ Automatic recommendation system
- ✅ Gradient calculation between stations
- ✅ Gradient limit enforcement (6% for metro, 3% for train)

**Depth Options**:
```
Surface:  $5M   | 6 months  | Difficulty 2 | 0m depth
Shallow:  $15M  | 1 year    | Difficulty 4 | 10m depth
Medium:   $35M  | 1.5 years | Difficulty 6 | 25m depth
Deep:     $75M  | 2 years   | Difficulty 8 | 50m depth
```

**Obstacle Types**:
- Building foundations (2.5x-10x cost, can be blocking)
- Bedrock (1.5x cost, deeper depths)
- Water table (1.8x cost, shallow depths)
- Utilities (1.2x cost, shallow depths)
- Archaeological sites (3.0x cost, rare but expensive)

- ✅ Stats display (cost, time, difficulty)
- ✅ Confirm/Cancel buttons
- ✅ Responsive grid layout

**UI Features**:
- Depth circles with meter indicators

## 🚧 INTEGRATION IN PROGRESS

### What's Left:
The system is 95% complete but needs final integration into MapViewer.tsx:

1. **Fix MapViewer.tsx** (file got corrupted during edit)
   - Move `createStationAtPosition` function outside useEffect
   - Add DepthSelector component to render
   - Wire up onSelect and onCancel callbacks

2. **Test the Flow**:
   ```
   User clicks map → 
   If metro/train → Show DepthSelector →
   User selects depth → Station created with chosen depth →
   Cost deducted from balance
   ```

---

## 📋 HOW IT WORKS

### User Flow:
1. **Select Metro or Train** tool
2. **Click on map** to place station
3. **Depth Selector appears** showing 4 options
4. **System analyzes** underground conditions
5. **Obstacles detected** and costs calculated
6. **Recommended option** highlighted
7. **User selects depth** or cancels
8. **Station created** with chosen depth and cost

### Technical Flow:
```typescript
// 1. User clicks map
handleMapClick(e) {
  if (selectedTool === 'metro' || 'train') {
    setPendingStationPosition([lat, lng, 0])
    setShowDepthSelector(true)
  }
}

// 2. DepthSelector analyzes location
foundationAnalyzer.analyzeLocation(position, buildings, stations)
// Returns 4 DepthOptions with obstacles and costs

// 3. User selects depth
onSelect(depth, cost) {
  createStationAtPosition(position, depth, cost)
  // Station created with:
  // - Correct depth in meters
  // - Elevator/escalator based on depth
  // - Accessibility rating based on depth
  // - Total construction cost
}
```

## 🎯 FEATURES BREAKDOWN

### Foundation Analysis
```typescript
interface DepthOption {
  depth: 'surface' | 'shallow' | 'medium' | 'deep'
  depthMeters: number
  baseCost: number
  obstacles: FoundationObstacle[]
  totalCostMultiplier: number
  constructionTime: number // days
  difficulty: number // 1-10
  description: string
  recommended: boolean
}
```

### Obstacle Detection
```typescript
interface FoundationObstacle {
  type: 'building_foundation' | 'bedrock' | 'water_table' | 'utility' | 'archaeological'
  depth: number
  severity: 'minor' | 'moderate' | 'severe' | 'blocking'
  costMultiplier: number
  description: string
  position: [number, number]
}
```

### Gradient Validation
```typescript
calculateTunnelSegment(startStation, endStation) {
  // Calculates gradient percentage
  // Validates against limits (6% metro, 3% train)
  // Returns warnings if too steep
  // Suggests intermediate stations if needed
}
```

## 💡 SMART FEATURES

### 1. Automatic Recommendation
The system automatically recommends the best depth based on:
- Total cost (base cost × obstacle multipliers)
- Construction difficulty
- Construction time
- Balance between cost and practicality

### 2. Obstacle Simulation
Realistic obstacle generation:
- **Building foundations**: Check nearby buildings within 100m
- **Bedrock**: More likely at deeper depths (30% chance >30m)
- **Water table**: More likely at shallow depths (40% chance <20m)
- **Utilities**: Common at shallow depths (50% chance <15m)
- **Archaeological**: Rare but expensive (5% chance anywhere)

### 3. Cost Multipliers
Obstacles multiply the base cost:
- Protected buildings: 10x (effectively blocks construction)
- Archaeological sites: 3x
- Regular building foundations: 2.5x
- Water table: 1.8x
- Bedrock: 1.5x
- Utilities: 1.2x

Multiple obstacles multiply together!

### 4. Station Attributes by Depth
```typescript
surface:  { elevator: false, escalator: false, accessibility: 100 }
shallow:  { elevator: true,  escalator: false, accessibility: 80 }
medium:   { elevator: true,  escalator: true,  accessibility: 70 }
deep:     { elevator: true,  escalator: true,  accessibility: 70 }
```

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES

1. **MapViewer.tsx corrupted** during last edit
   - Need to properly extract `createStationAtPosition` function
   - Need to add DepthSelector component to render

2. **Obstacle detection is simulated**
   - Real implementation would query actual building data
   - Could integrate with OSM building heights
   - Could use geological data APIs

3. **No visual tunnel representation yet**
   - Planned: 3D tunnel visualization
   - Planned: Cross-section view showing depth
   - Planned: Gradient visualization between stations

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (to complete this feature):
1. Fix MapViewer.tsx integration
2. Test depth selector with metro/train
3. Verify cost deduction works
4. Test gradient validation between stations

### Future Enhancements:
1. **3D Tunnel Visualization**
   - Show tunnel depth on map
   - Cross-section view
   - Gradient visualization

2. **Real Building Data**
   - Query OSM for actual building heights
   - Calculate real foundation depths
   - Use actual geological data

3. **Construction Animation**
   - Show construction progress
   - Animate tunnel boring
   - Visual feedback for delays

4. **Advanced Obstacles**
   - Underground rivers
   - Fault lines
   - Existing tunnels (conflict detection)
   - Protected zones

## 💻 CODE EXAMPLES

### Using Foundation Analyzer:
```typescript
import { foundationAnalyzer } from '../utils/foundationAnalysis'

const options = foundationAnalyzer.analyzeLocation(
  [lat, lng, 0],
  buildings,
  existingStations
)

// Returns 4 DepthOptions
options.forEach(option => {
  console.log(`${option.depth}: $${option.baseCost}M`)
  console.log(`Obstacles: ${option.obstacles.length}`)
  console.log(`Total cost: $${option.baseCost * option.totalCostMultiplier}M`)
})
```

### Using Depth Selector:
```tsx
<DepthSelector
  position={[lat, lng, 0]}
  onSelect={(depth, cost) => {
    // Create station with selected depth
    createStation(position, depth, cost)
  }}
  onCancel={() => {
    // User cancelled
  }}
/>
```

## 🎯 IMPACT

This feature adds:
- **Strategic depth**: Choose between cheap/fast vs expensive/safe
- **Realistic constraints**: Can't always build where you want
- **Cost management**: Balance budget vs optimal routes
- **Technical challenge**: Gradient limits force smart planning
- **Replayability**: Different obstacles each game

**This is a MAJOR feature** that significantly enhances gameplay depth!
