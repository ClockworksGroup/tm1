## üìù NOTES

**This is an ambitious project!** Implementing all 20 features properly will take significant time. The roadmap above assumes:
- Full-time development (8 hours/day)
- Experienced developer
- No major blockers

**Recommendation**: Focus on **Phase 1** first to get the core gameplay loop working, then iterate based on player feedback.

**Current Priority**: Complete vehicle simulation and get vehicles moving on the map - this will make the biggest immediate impact on gameplay feel.
