# Vehicle Simulation Implementation - Progress Summary

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Last 30 minutes)

### 1. Vehicle Simulation Core System
- ‚úÖ Created `src/utils/vehicleSimulation.ts`
  - VehicleState interface for tracking vehicle positions
  - VehicleSimulator class with update loop
  - Position interpolation between stations
  - Boarding/alighting simulation
  - Distance calculations (Haversine formula)

### 2. Game Loop Hook
- ‚úÖ Created `src/hooks/useGameLoop.ts`
  - Continuous update loop using requestAnimationFrame
  - Game speed support (pause, normal, fast, very fast)
  - Integration with vehicle simulator

### 3. State Management
- ‚úÖ Updated `src/store/gameStore.ts`
  - Added `vehicleStates: Map<string, VehicleState>` to track real-time positions
  - Added `updateVehiclePositions()` method
  - Imported VehicleState type

### 4. Documentation
- ‚úÖ Created `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` - Complete 12-week plan for all 20 features
- ‚úÖ This progress summary

## üöß IN PROGRESS - Next Steps

### Step 1: Create VehicleLayer Component
**File**: `src/components/VehicleLayer.tsx`
**Purpose**: Render moving vehicles on the map as markers

**What it needs to do**:
- Subscribe to `vehicleStates` from store
- For each vehicle, get its current position
- Render a marker at that position
- Update marker position every frame
- Different icons for metro/bus/tram/train

### Step 2: Integrate Game Loop
**File**: `src/components/GameUI.tsx` or `src/App.tsx`
**Purpose**: Start the game loop

**What to do**:
- Import and call `useGameLoop()` hook
- This will start the continuous update cycle

### Step 3: Add Vehicle Spawning
**File**: `src/utils/vehicleSpawner.ts` (new)
**Purpose**: Automatically create vehicles for lines based on frequency

**What it needs**:
- Check each line's frequency setting
- Spawn vehicles at appropriate intervals
- Initialize vehicles in the simulator
- Add to game store

### Step 4: Visual Testing
- Create a test line with 3-4 stations
- Spawn a vehicle on that line
- Watch it move between stations
- Verify boarding/alighting works

## üìã REMAINING WORK FOR VEHICLE SIMULATION

### High Priority
1. **VehicleLayer Component** (30 min)
   - Render vehicles as map markers
   - Update positions in real-time
   
2. **Vehicle Spawner** (20 min)
   - Auto-create vehicles based on line frequency
   - Stagger vehicle starts

3. **Vehicle Icons** (15 min)
   - Create/find SVG icons for each transport type
   - Color-code by line

### Medium Priority
4. **Vehicle UI Panel** (30 min)
   - Show list of all vehicles
   - Click vehicle to focus on map
   - Show status (moving, stopped, boarding)

5. **Performance Optimization** (20 min)
   - Only render vehicles in viewport
   - Throttle position updates
   - Use CSS transforms for smooth movement

### Low Priority
6. **Advanced Features** (later)
   - Vehicle breakdowns
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Depot assignment
   - Passenger capacity visualization

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK

**Create VehicleLayer.tsx** to render vehicles on the map.

This will make vehicles visible and complete the basic vehicle simulation!

## üìä Overall Feature Progress

| Feature | Status | % Complete |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Vehicle Simulation | üöß In Progress | 60% |
| Dynamic Demand | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started | 0% |
| Transfer Stations | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started | 0% |
| Metro Depth System | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started | 0% |
| Construction Phases | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started | 0% |
| ... (16 more features) | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not Started | 0% |

**Total Progress**: 3% of all 20 features

## üí° RECOMMENDATION

**Focus on finishing vehicle simulation first** before moving to other features. Once vehicles are moving on the map, the game will feel much more alive and it will be easier to see the value of adding other features.

**Estimated time to complete vehicle simulation**: 1-2 more hours
