# Transport Master - Development Session Summary
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Session Duration:** ~2 hours

---

## üéØ Major Accomplishments

### 1. **Fixed Line Creation with Existing Stations** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** When creating a new transport line that reused existing stations, money was deducted but the line wasn't created.

**Root Cause:**
- Construction cost was calculated for ALL stations (new + existing)
- Stations were added before checking if player could afford the line
- If player couldn't afford it, stations were still added but line creation failed

**Solution:**
- Modified `MapViewer.tsx` to only charge for NEW stations
- Added funds check BEFORE adding stations
- Reordered operations: check funds ‚Üí add line ‚Üí add new stations
- Added `existingStationIds` Set to track which stations already exist

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/MapViewer.tsx` (lines 467-531)

---

### 2. **Implemented Toast Notification System** üé®
**Problem:** Using ugly browser `alert()` for game notifications.

**Solution:**
- Created beautiful toast notification system with:
  - Glassmorphism design
  - Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
  - Smooth slide-in animations
  - Color-coded by type (success, error, info, warning)
  - Icons for each type
  - Manual close button
  - Multiple toasts stack vertically

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` - Toast component
- `src/hooks/useToast.tsx` - Toast state management with Zustand

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/GameUI.tsx` - Added toast container
- `src/components/MapViewer.tsx` - Replaced alerts with toasts

**Toast Types:**
- ‚úÖ Success (green) - Line created successfully
- ‚ùå Error (red) - Insufficient funds
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info (blue) - General information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning (yellow) - Warnings

---

### 3. **Fixed Infinite Render Loop** üîÑ
**Problem:** Lines were being redrawn every game tick (every time passenger data updated), causing performance issues.

**Root Cause:**
- `useEffect` dependency on `lines` array
- Passenger simulation updates stations immutably every tick
- This triggered line redraw constantly

**Solution:**
- Track line IDs with `useRef` instead of full array
- Only redraw when line IDs change (add/remove)
- Added `hasInitialDrawn` ref to ensure lines draw on first load
- Changed from `[lines]` to `[lines, map.current?.isStyleLoaded()]`

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/MapViewer.tsx` (lines 251-268)

---

### 4. **Lines Now Show on Initial Load** üó∫Ô∏è
**Problem:** Lines only appeared after creating a new line, not when loading a saved game.

**Solution:**
- Added `hasInitialDrawn` ref to track first render
- Always draw on first load, then only on ID changes
- Ensures saved games show lines immediately

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/MapViewer.tsx` (lines 252-253)

---

### 5. **Redesigned Line Management Panel** üé®
**Problem:** Line Manager didn't match main menu branding.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Brand Accent Color:** Changed from generic red to `#c90a43` (brand pink/red)
- **Accent Lines:** Added horizontal top bar and vertical left bar
- **Glassmorphism:** 70% opacity with backdrop-blur-2xl
- **Sharp Design:** Removed all border radius from buttons/inputs
- **Button Styling:** Primary actions use brand color, secondary use subtle white
- **Rounded Modal:** Added `rounded-lg` to modal container

**Visual Changes:**
- Top: 1px horizontal accent bar (#c90a43)
- Header: 1px vertical accent bar next to title
- Buttons: Sharp edges, brand color for primary actions
- Background: Transparent with blur (can see map behind)
- Typography: font-light, tracking-wide (consistent with main menu)

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/ui/LineManager.tsx` (complete redesign)

---

### 6. **Added Map Antialiasing** üéÆ
**Problem:** 3D buildings looked pixelated and sharp.

**Solution:**
- Enabled `antialias: true` in MapLibre GL JS configuration
- Used TypeScript type assertion to bypass type errors
- Smooth, professional-looking 3D buildings

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/MapViewer.tsx` (line 48)

---

### 7. **Fixed Passenger Count Display** üë•
**Problem:** Passenger counts showed decimals and weren't updating in real-time.

**Root Causes:**
- Floating-point arithmetic in passenger calculations
- Direct mutation of station objects (Zustand couldn't detect changes)
- `StationPopup` not re-rendering when data changed

**Solutions:**
- Applied `Math.floor()` to all passenger calculations
- Changed from `forEach` to `map` for immutable updates
- Used `set({ stations: updatedStations })` to trigger Zustand reactivity
- Added `Math.floor()` in UI display as safety net

**Files Changed:**
- `src/store/gameStore.ts` (lines 496-559)
- `src/components/ui/StationPopup.tsx` (line 80)
